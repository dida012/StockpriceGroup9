### Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict the daily closing stock price (close) of publicly traded companies using historical stock price and volume data obtained from the FinancialModelingPrep Stock Price and Volume Data API.

The dataset contains daily trading indicators such as `open price, high price, low price, trading volume, price changes, and volume-weighted average price (VWAP)`. These indicators are used as input features to build machine learning regression models that estimate the stock’s closing price.

###### Why This Is a Real-World Problem
This problem is highly relevant in real-world financial systems for several reasons:

1.Used in Finance and Trading Systems

2.Supports Investment and Risk Analysis

3.Improves Decision-Making in Stock Markets

4.Based on Real Market Data



###### Target Variable
Target: close

Represents the final traded price of a stock at the end of the trading day..

###### Machine Learning Problem Type
Problem Type: Regression

Reason:

The target variable (close) is a continuous numerical value.
